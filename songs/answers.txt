I will calucalate the avearge of energy, valence and tempo of the songs to characterize the audio aura.

Some listeners may have large diversity on what songs they have listened to. So the average value of the energy, valence and tempo may not
be a good indicator to show what the listeners like. During characterizing the audio aura, the standard deviation of those value should
also be considered.
