Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
For smaller number of simulation (e.g. N = 10), the teams with lower rating (e.g. Japan) has higher
winning chance than the teams with higher rating (e.g. France). When the number of simulation become
higher, it would not happen again.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would say 1000 simulations would be good enough. As the simulation results from N = 10000 and N = 100000
are simialr to the one with N = 1000
